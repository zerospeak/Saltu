        E[Workflow Engine]:::backend
        F[Authentication]:::security
    end

    subgraph AI["AI Services"]
        G[Matching Engine]:::ai
        H[Analytics Engine]:::ai
    end

    subgraph Data["Data Layer"]
        I[(PostgreSQL)]:::data
        J[(Neo4j)]:::data
        K[(Redis Cache)]:::data
    end

    A & B & C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    E --> G
    G --> H
    E & G & H --> I
    G & H --> J
    D & E --> K
```



The diagram above illustrates the platform's high-level architecture, where:

- Blue components represent frontend services
- Green components show backend services
- Purple indicates AI/ML services
- Orange represents data storage
- Red highlights security components

Key relationships shown include:

- All frontend portals communicate through the API Gateway
- The Workflow Engine orchestrates core business processes
- AI services interact with both PostgreSQL and Neo4j for different data needs
- Redis Cache provides performance optimization across services

####  7.2 Data Flow Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    classDef frontend fill:#42A5F5,color:#fff,stroke:#1976D2
    classDef backend fill:#66BB6A,color:#fff,stroke:#388E3C
    classDef ai fill:#AB47BC,color:#fff,stroke:#7B1FA2
    classDef data fill:#FFA726,color:#fff,stroke:#F57C00

    subgraph Client["Client Portal"]
        A[Job Posting]:::frontend
        B[Requirements]:::frontend
    end

    subgraph AI["AI Processing"]
        C[Matching Engine]:::ai
        D[Analytics Engine]:::ai
    end

    subgraph Data["Data Storage"]
        E[(PostgreSQL)]:::data
        F[(Neo4j)]:::data
    end

    subgraph Candidate["Candidate Portal"]
        G[Profile]:::frontend
        H[Preferences]:::frontend
    end

    A & B --> C
    G & H --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    D --> F
    E --> B
    F --> G
```



This data flow diagram illustrates how information moves through the system:

- Client inputs (job postings and requirements) flow into the AI Matching Engine
- Candidate profiles and preferences are processed simultaneously
- The Analytics Engine transforms processed data into insights
- PostgreSQL stores structured data (job requirements, candidate information)
- Neo4j maintains relationship data (matching scores, preferences)
- Bidirectional arrows show how data is continuously updated and referenced

####  7.3 AI Matching Process

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    classDef input fill:#42A5F5,color:#fff,stroke:#1976D2
    classDef process fill:#66BB6A,color:#fff,stroke:#388E3C
    classDef ai fill:#AB47BC,color:#fff,stroke:#7B1FA2
    classDef output fill:#FFA726,color:#fff,stroke:#F57C00

    subgraph Input["Input Data"]
        A[Job Description]:::input
        B[Candidate Profile]:::input
        C[Historical Data]:::input
    end

    subgraph Processing["Processing Layer"]
        D[NLP Engine]:::process
        E[Feature Extraction]:::process
        F[Vectorization]:::process
    end

    subgraph AI["AI Processing"]
        G[ML Model]:::ai
        H[Ranking Algorithm]:::ai
    end

    subgraph Output["Results"]
        I[Match Scores]:::output
        J[Recommendations]:::output
        K[Analytics]:::output
    end

    A & B & C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
    G --> H
    H --> I & J & K
```



This diagram shows the AI matching process in detail:

- Input data combines job descriptions, candidate profiles, and historical matching data
- The processing layer transforms raw text into machine-readable formats
- NLP Engine extracts meaningful features from text
- Feature Extraction identifies relevant skills and qualifications
- Vectorization converts features into numerical representations
- The ML Model processes these vectors to generate match scores
- Results include both immediate matches and long-term analytics

####  7.4 Deployment Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    classDef frontend fill:#42A5F5,color:#fff,stroke:#1976D2
    classDef backend fill:#66BB6A,color:#fff,stroke:#388E3C
    classDef ai fill:#AB47BC,color:#fff,stroke:#7B1FA2
    classDef data fill:#FFA726,color:#fff,stroke:#F57C00
    classDef security fill:#FF7043,color:#fff,stroke:#E64A19

    subgraph Client["Client Layer"]
        A[Load Balancer]:::security
        B[CDN]:::security
        C[Client Portal]:::frontend
        D[Candidate Portal]:::frontend
    end

    subgraph Backend["Backend Layer"]
        E[API Gateway]:::security
        F[Workflow Engine]:::backend
        G[Authentication]:::security
    end

    subgraph AI["AI Layer"]
        H[Matching Engine]:::ai
        I[Analytics Engine]:::ai
    end

    subgraph Data["Data Layer"]
        J[(PostgreSQL)]:::data
        K[(Neo4j)]:::data
        L[(Redis Cache)]:::data
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C & D
    C & D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
    F --> H
    H --> I
    F & H & I --> J
    H & I --> K
    E & F --> L
```



This deployment architecture diagram shows the production-ready infrastructure:

- Security is implemented at multiple layers:
  - Load balancer and CDN at the edge
  - API Gateway for request validation
  - Authentication service for access control


- Components are distributed across layers for scalability:
  - Client layer handles user interactions
  - Backend layer manages business logic
  - AI layer processes complex matching algorithms
  - Data layer ensures high availability and performance



These four diagrams together provide a complete picture of the system:

1. System architecture shows the high-level component relationships
2. Data flow diagram illustrates information movement
3. AI matching process details the core algorithm
4. Deployment architecture shows production-ready infrastructure

This visualization set enables stakeholders to understand both the technical implementation and operational aspects of the platform, from data flow to security considerations.
